Kill the monster game! 
( modified Crystal Collector Game)
Instructions:

How to kill the monster: Every monster has a random amount of life given to it. Use the weapons provided to kill the monster.

Every monster reacts differently to the weapons. Some weapons work better than others each round.

You will only win if you bring the monsters damage down to exactly 0. Otherwise you will have wasted resources, leaving you susceptible to future destruction!
